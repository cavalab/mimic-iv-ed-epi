# Study design

We conducted a single-center retrospective cross-sectional study of ED visits by adults to BIDMC, recorded in the MIMIC-IV-ED dataset (in table `edstays`). Visits were excluded if they did not have a valid recorded `in-time` (time of arrival to the ED) or `out-time` (time at which they left the ED); to be valid, an in-time had to precede the recorded out-time. We obtained vital signs taken at triage (from table `triage`) and excluded visits for which such data was not available, or where vitals fell outside a reasonable range (e.g. a temperature of 200 degrees Farenheit). We obtained vital signs recorded during a patient's stay (from table `vitalsigns`), but included stays without such information, as many patients may be admitted too quickly to allow repeated vital assessments. 

Age was obtained to the nearest year by linkage to MIMIC-IV (from table `patients`), assuming a birthday of January 1st for each patient. The group of years associated with each patient's care was obtained from the same table, and could precede 2011; as only one year group could be associated with each patient regardless of the time frame of their visits, we took this as a rough ordering of the time periods in which different patients engaged with the hospital system, rather than a precise temporal identifier. We took ICD codes relating to the diagnosis arising from each ED stay from table `diagnosis`, considering only the most relevant code, and converted these to Charlson comorbidity scores (a measure of severity) using the R package `comorbidity` (Gasparini 2018). Visits were excluded if no ICD code was available; linked ages were observed for all patients.

Patient-reported pain, a free-text field, was converted to a score between 0 and 10, or recorded as "unable to answer" or "non-numeric response" if such a conversion was impossible. Chief complaints were converted to 54 manually curated binary indicators covering the most frequent reasons given for a visit to the ER, such that 88% of visits were described by at least one variable.

Visits resulting in an admission to hospital were assigned a specific linkage ID which allowed us to obtain data on the patient's insurance status, marital status, and primary language from the MIMIC-IV dataset. These data were not available for visits which did not result in an admission. As a result, we were only able to control for these variables when examining demographic disparities in LOS amongst those admitted to the hospital.

# Usage 


## Requirements

- R version 4.4.2 or higher
- `packages.txt` contains the R libraries that are needed. To install them, run `Rscript install_packages.r`. 
- [MIMIC-IV-ED dataset (v 2.2) from Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/), mapped to the directory `mimic-iv-ed` in the repo root. 
- [MIMIC-IV dataset (v 3.1) from Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/), mapped to the directory `mimic-iv-3.1` in the repo root.

## Preprocessing

These files, run in order, reproduce the analysis we've used to analyse the MIMIC-IV-ED dataset.
To run them all, run `preprocess.sh` (from a *nix system). 

1. `edstays-extract-time-of-day-and-previous-visits.r`: extracts time spent in ER, time of arrival, year group associated with patient, and visit history.
2. `edstays_triage_data_cleaning_mult_visits.r`: cleans and categorises vital signs, pain scores, and demographic variables.
3. `mimic-chief-complaint.r`: translates the free-text `chief complaint` field to a series of 54 binary indicators associated with each visit.
4. `link-with-mimic-iv.r`: obtains patient age at each visit from the MIMIC-IV dataset, and translates ICD codes associated with each stay to a Charlson score. Also obtains insurance, marital, and language info for visits resulting in an admission.
5. `edstays-triage-hists.r`: produces histograms showing the distribution of variables across the cohort, allowing at-a-glance identification of reference groups.
6. `mimic_mult_visit_with_vitals_binary_recode.r`: reformat data on all visits to ER to a series of binary indicators.
7. `adm_edstays_binary_recode.r`: reformat data on all visits to ER *resulting in an admission* to a series of binary indicators, including additional covariates.
8. `edstays_add_vitalsigns_during_stay.r`: attach data on vital signs from readings taken during a patient's stay, cleaned, categorised, and reformat as binary indicators.

## Propensity score and Odds Ratio Calculations
All other files (starting "ps2") are named according to their exposure and outcome. These fit propensity scores for a given exposure variable, calculate odds ratios using two PS methodologies (covariate adjustment and matching with McNemar's test), save them, and produce OR plots (for categorical exposures).
